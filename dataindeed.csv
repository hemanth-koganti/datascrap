Entry Level Full Stack Software Developer,Labatt Food Service,"San Antonio, TX",,"Labatt Food Service is now hiring entry level full stack Software Developers.
Are you looking for a fun career in software development and knowing that your efforts directly impact the success of the business? Do you want to work in small teams where you are part of the design and direction of the projects? Do you want to work with smart people and grow with the group, sharing your knowledge and learning from others? Do you have a passion for writing code and finding solutions to difficult problems?
At Labatt Food Service we consider ourselves a sophisticated software company that sells food, and our track record speaks for itself. We continue to grow every year and succeed against competitors 50 times our size by being innovators and building long term, respectful relationships with our customers, vendors and employees. Though we are smaller than some larger competitors, we are often first to market with new technologies. Many of our new initiatives eventually become standard across the industry, and we have thus established an unrivaled reputation as being a thought-leader in our industry.
Role & Responsibilities
Labatt’s developers create and continuously improve all the systems that run the business. Software and data analytics play a huge part in the success of the company, and therefore software developers have a significant impact on the company. Since the very beginning, Labatt has focused on writing all of its own code, allowing the company to move quickly into new areas and be flexible to customer needs. Our team of software developers design, test, and continually re-engineer the critical systems that keep all aspects of the business running at full steam. Developers work as members of small teams, and employ Agile methodologies to bring about the internal-efficiency and customer-facing innovations that are necessary to keep our lead in the industry. Our philosophy of investing in clean code and developing people from within allows us to build for the long term and leverage the most forward-thinking APIs, languages, and practices, to take on the most intellectually challenging projects that our industry faces.
As a software developer at Labatt, you will take on projects approximately 6 months in length, iterate on a small team of 3-5, test thoroughly, design clean & modular code, experiment, learn, be challenged, and serve the needs of the business. All developers are expected to contribute to the team's success by solving non-trivial problems and sharing lessons learned with the group. Developers are also expected to follow the group's established coding and process best practices as established by the group to ensure quality and consistent code - code that will last for many years. That said, developers have a significant amount of freedom over their projects and the ability to experiment with newer technologies and practices that may help the group overall.
About Labatt Food Service:
Labatt Food Service, founded in 1968 and headquartered in San Antonio, Texas is a privately owned company and the tenth largest foodservice distributor in the nation, servicing food-away-from-home customers in five states. The company currently has over 1600 employees and over 6000 customers, including school districts, military bases, restaurant chains, convenience store chains, and individual outlets. Over the 50+ years Labatt has existed as a B2B food distribution and logistics company, sales have grown from $8 million to over $1.3B annually and we expect to continue to grow each year.
Our Current Stack
Developers at Labatt Food Service use a variety of technologies, including:
C#, Visual Basic, Golang, IBM RPG, Vue.js, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, and SQL.
Requirements
The developers who do best at Labatt must have the ability to think both strategically and tactically, the discipline to set and hit deadlines, an appetite for hard work and continuous personal improvement, a passion for working and effectively communicating with others, and a commitment to the success of the overall organization.
Proficiency in coding and the ability to write clean, functional code is a must, although we train everyone to our particular style and needs. We understand that developers learn and use different technologies over time. We are more interested in finding developers who can think and write code and are less interested in ""X years with Y technology"". No matter the starting skill level, developers are expected to improve over time.
A bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field is required.
Entry level developers work in teams with more experienced developers and are expected to contribute to user stories as well as the implementation and design of the software projects.

Developers work as members of small teams, and employ Agile methodologies to bring about the internal-efficiency and customer-facing innovations that are necessary to keep our lead in the industry. Our philosophy of investing in clean code and developing people from within allows us to build for the long term and leverage the most forward-thinking APIs, languages, and practices, to take on the most intellectually challenging projects that our industry faces.
As a software developer at Labatt, you will take on projects approximately 6 months in length, iterate on a small team of 3-5, test thoroughly, design clean & modular code, experiment, learn, be challenged, and serve the needs of the business. All developers are expected to contribute to the team's success by solving non-trivial problems and sharing lessons learned with the group. Developers are also expected to follow the group's established coding and process best practices as established by the group to ensure quality and consistent code - code that will last for many years. That said, developers have a significant amount of freedom over their projects and the ability to experiment with newer technologies and practices that may help the group overall.

The Role: Full Stack Software Developer
Shareworks by Morgan Stanley is looking for
Intermediate Full-Stack Developers
for our
Sandy, UT
development team.
Do you want to work with a system that gets a half million logins from one hundred thousand users per month? How about write code for an industry-leading financial services platform that transacts more than ten billion dollars a year? Do you think it would be cool to be a part of the team that expands this platform to transact one trillion dollars for ten million users?
You aren’t dogmatic; you’re pragmatic. You know that “agile” means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You are a craftsperson. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don’t run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and time zones.
It doesn’t matter if it’s Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up. You aim to build commercial products that people use - technology is just a means to an end. We are looking for developers of all experience levels to help us build a fast, reliable, secure, and resilient enterprise platform on a global scale.
Things we believe
:
Results matter, not the clock.
Code and technology are what we use to solve problems, not the whole of our job.
Free tools are great unless they aren’t the best. We use high-end Linux workstations with big monitors and tools like IDEA, JRebel and the Atlassian suite to keep us in the zone.
Things we like:
Prior experience with production large-scale distributed systems
Familiarity with technologies we use (Java, Spring, GWT, Struts, JPA, EJB, REST, React, Redux)
A hunger for tracking down root causes - no matter how deep the rabbit hole
A BS in CS (or related degrees) is appreciated but not necessary with the right background
What you’ll do
:
Be customer focused - learn about the business to help bring value to our customers
Act technology driven - design, implement, and test new functionality
Own the product - figure out how to automate tests to delivery quality, and we find and fix our own bugs
Work with Product Management to deliver material value to our clients
Do full stack dev from the DB to the UI - Use your experience to help the whole team get better
What you’ll get
:
Market rate salary based on experience
Casual Environment - we don't have a dress code, but we do have flexible working hours!
20 Paid Days off + 9 holidays
A chance to shape our team as we build

The Role: Full Stack Software Developer
Shareworks by Morgan Stanley is looking for
Junior Full-Stack Developers
for our
Sandy, UT
development team.
Do you want to work with a system that gets a half million logins from one hundred thousand users per month? How about write code for an industry-leading financial services platform that transacts more than ten billion dollars a year? Do you think it would be cool to be a part of the team that expands this platform to transact one trillion dollars for ten million users?
You aren’t dogmatic; you’re pragmatic. You know that “agile” means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You are a craftsperson. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don’t run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and time zones.
It doesn’t matter if it’s Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up. You aim to build commercial products that people use - technology is just a means to an end. We are looking for developers of all experience levels to help us build a fast, reliable, secure, and resilient enterprise platform on a global scale.
Things we believe
:
Results matter, not the clock.
Code and technology are what we use to solve problems, not the whole of our job.
Free tools are great unless they aren’t the best. We use high-end Linux workstations with big monitors and tools like IDEA, JRebel and the Atlassian suite to keep us in the zone.
Things we like:
Prior experience with production large-scale distributed systems
Familiarity with technologies we use (Java, Spring, GWT, Struts, JPA, EJB, REST, React, Redux)
A hunger for tracking down root causes - no matter how deep the rabbit hole
A BS in CS (or related degrees) is appreciated but not necessary with the right background
What you’ll do
:
Be customer focused - learn about the business to help bring value to our customers
Act technology driven - design, implement, and test new functionality
Own the product - figure out how to automate tests to delivery quality, and we find and fix our own bugs
Work with Product Management to deliver material value to our clients
Do full stack dev from the DB to the UI - Use your experience to help the whole team get better
What you’ll get
:
Market rate salary based on experience
Casual Environment - we don't have a dress code, but we do have flexible working hours!
20 Paid Days off + 9 holidays

Senior Backend Developer
Location:
Chicago, IL or Buffalo Grove, IL
Company Overview
Zoro's secret recipe to delight our customers has been hugely successful. In the past seven years, Zoro has grown from a group of 6 people working out of a 2,000 square foot building, offering fewer than 100,000 products to a group of 300+, offering more than 2,300,000 unique products.
Position Description
We now want to scale our secret recipe which is why we need talented folks like you to help us provide a world-class customer experience by developing and delivering game-changing digital solutions.
Zoro engineering is embarking on an exciting journey to build core engineering competencies that will enable us to make 100s of targeted releases daily, delighting our customers and giving them the best experience possible. Our engineering team is composed of a talented group of front-end, back-end, and full-stack engineers. We’re looking for an experienced Senior Software Engineer to join our team of gifted developers and begin your journey of unleashing your true potential.
Constant improvements to zoro.com are delivered by our product teams. You will be on a high performing scrum team with approximately 4-6 software engineers as well as a dedicated tech lead, product owner, and architect. Ideally we are looking for engineers who are well rounded in building scalable applications but that doesn’t mean we won’t provide an environment that’ll help you grow.
Your objective will be to build and support robust tools and applications that support our business. To be successful in this role you must be the kind of software engineer who can produce fast, space and memory efficient code. We have endless data being shipped around between applications and we cannot afford to fall behind. We don’t care if you taught yourself, attended a boot camp, or have a Computer Science degree; we care that you know your stuff. This means you have superb software engineering fundamentals, produce thoughtfully designed code that is reliable and maintainable. All of that is meaningless without thorough testing, of course. We’re looking for engineers that are enthusiastic about learning new technologies and skills that will continue to make a difference as Zoro steps the next step forward.
Essential Job Functions
Technologies We Use:
The language you use doesn’t have to match what we use. However for transparency we use Python almost exclusively on our backend but that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t use the right tool for the job moving forward.
As you are developing, testing should be at the forefront of your mind. Everything moving to production should have a unit test along with it.
We also utilize Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, RabbitMQ among others.
For our databases, we heavily rely on Elasticsearch, MySQL, and Redis. We have a couple other platforms in use throughout our applications.
Our cloud platform is currently AWS but are transitioning to GCP. It’s important to understand the tools and services offered by a cloud service provider in order to choose the best option for your application.
git push origin source-control
Are there others? Yes. Is our stack fun? Yes. Will you get to work on what interests you? Yes. Should you apply? Yes.
Requirements
Degree in Computer Science, a related technical or scientific field, or equivalent experience
4-6 years experience as a software engineer
Familiarity with continuous integration and build tools
Mastery of one programming language and working knowledge of at least one other
Familiarity with multiple frameworks from languages and domains
Understanding of multiple programming paradigms
Good grasp of design patterns and anti-patterns
Final note
We share a commitment to our Zoro values – Win & Lose Together (We prefer winning!), Take Ownership, We Are Transparent, and Aspire to be Customer-Obsessed. Everything we do at Zoro is centered around delighting our customers. It's a natural extension of our company culture and how we care for each other. We believe when we act in ways that are consistent with these values, we can solve any technical challenge the lies ahead of us. As a Zoro employee, you can expect to work with smart, energetic people, learn something every day, and be valued for your perspective.",https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=8f328b4bc9684f27&from=serp&vjs=3

development team.
Do you want to work with a system that gets a half million logins from one hundred thousand users per month? How about write code for an industry-leading financial services platform that transacts more than ten billion dollars a year? Do you think it would be cool to be a part of the team that expands this platform to transact one trillion dollars for ten million users?
You aren’t dogmatic; you’re pragmatic. You know that “agile” means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You are a craftsperson. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don’t run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like localization, security, and time zones.
It doesn’t matter if it’s Ant or Gradle, Struts or Spring, jQuery or GWT - you know it or you can pick it up. You aim to build commercial products that people use - technology is just a means to an end. We are looking for developers of all experience levels to help us build a fast, reliable, secure, and resilient enterprise platform on a global scale.
Things we believe
:
Results matter, not the clock.
Code and technology are what we use to solve problems, not the whole of our job.
Free tools are great unless they aren’t the best. We use high-end Linux workstations with big monitors and tools like IDEA, JRebel and the Atlassian suite to keep us in the zone.
Things we like:
Prior experience with production large-scale distributed systems
Familiarity with technologies we use (Java, Spring, GWT, Struts, JPA, EJB, REST, React, Redux)
A hunger for tracking down root causes - no matter how deep the rabbit hole
A BS in CS (or related degrees) is appreciated but not necessary with the right background
What you’ll do
:
Be customer focused - learn about the business to help bring value to our customers
Act technology driven - design, implement, and test new functionality
Own the product - figure out how to automate tests to delivery quality, and we find and fix our own bugs
Work with Product Management to deliver material value to our clients
Do full stack dev from the DB to the UI - Use your experience to help the whole team get better
What you’ll get
:
Market rate salary based on experience
Casual Environment - we don't have a dress code, but we do have flexible working hours!

Joining the Statuspage team means you get to play with some of the latest tech as part of a tight-knit, fast-moving team. You’ll be shipping live code into production starting week one.

Hive Data allows us to label uncommonly large datasets at a fraction of the cost that other data labelling solutions would charge. Once Hive Data was built, we were able to quickly label enormous datasets and rapidly build a suite of machine learning models that now form our core offerings in Hive Predict.
Our
Hive Predict
team has since built a wide range of custom machine learning models spanning a range of verticals including media, retail, security, and autonomous driving. Drawing on this experience and expertise, we then set out to build a stand-alone analytics platform for TV advertising called
Hive Media
. Hive Media synthesises our company's fundamental technologies and leverages industry partnerships to deliver a truly revolutionary product. Hive offers the only true, full- stack deep learning platform in the world, assisting clients with data labelling, model building, and the development of full enterprise solutions.
Today, we work with some of the largest companies in the world to redefine how they think about unstructured visual data and together we build solutions that completely transform verticals. We are fortunate to be funded by leading investors like Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), General Catalyst, Formation 8, and others. We have ~100 people globally, based in our San Francisco and Gurugram offices.
The Role
You’ll be expected to own your space: work with all disciplines on your team to build, launch and iterate. You will work closely with the product team to conceptualize and execute on designs to solve problems for our products. This is a very rare opportunity that will put you in the position of total ownership of whole product from design perspective without the risk of starting your own company. Every designer at Hive has responsibility of a whole product, although we encourage the team to provide feedback to each other.
You are a talented designer who consistently delivers visuals and interactions of highest quality on timelines that would be unrealistic for many others. You take pride in your creative vision, execution and communication skills. You are a strong individual contributor, but also a team player. You enjoy taking ownership of full products, and are stifled by large design organizations.
You get a rush from seeing your designs live in the real world.
Responsibilities
Design projects across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches.
Work with small multi-disciplinary teams. You’ll partner closely with engineering, product, and business folks to find elegant but practical solutions to design challenges.
Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.
Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes
Job Prerequisites
3+ year of experience designing consumer and mobile products
Had ownership of many consumer products over the years, and understand what it takes to create awesome, consumer-oriented experiences
Biased toward action and execution. You get nervous if you’re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work
Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life
Constantly looking to hone your design instinct through user feedback. Whether through hands-on user research, or by designing options for an A / B test
You have an online portfolio (Behance/Dribbble) or PDF that you can share with us
What Hive offers you:
Hive offers an opportunity to work with exceptional people. We are a group of individuals who are young and hungry to make a mark on the world and build a long-term investment holding company. You will be based in Gurgaon, India Office and we offer all the standard benefits available to top startups. At Hive, you will have a significant career development opportunity and an opportunity to learn.

You will be an engineer behind a very fast-growing brand, working with our lead developer. Our growing codebase has been carefully built with attention to readability and scalability (we think you'll be pleased with it). We value well-designed code and getting things done
right
, but most importantly, getting them done. We take both technical debt and deadlines seriously.
You’ll need to be able to insert yourself anywhere needed: frontend, backend, everything in between. You won’t have to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and approvals to get product decisions made. You’ll be sharing an office space with the CEO.
We are investing in new digital experiences all the time, and expanding our offerings within the world of literature. You will be laying the technical foundation for long-term success of the company, while rapidly launching new features and iterations.
As a full-stack dev, you’ll...
Work directly with our CTO, CEO, and Creative Director on implementing new features, consumer facing updates, as well as backend tools for our supply chain and inventory.
Build solutions for appropriate scalability. You're ok building something ""hacky"" if it fits the need, but can also identify real issues and create well designed, elegant solutions to hard problems.
Explore how technology can enable our company mission.
Who You Are...
At this point, on the ""specialist"" vs ""generalist"" front, you tend to lean a bit generalist. You have the flexibility to move around the stack, from frontend templating and stylesheets to backend/sysadmin/databases.
An ideal candidate would be familiar with the following technologies in our stack: Linux systems administration, Ansible, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, React, jsx, ES6, Webpack, scss, Boostrap, jquery, css, html. Mobile app experience is a plus; you might be leading the development of one.
Okay, so maybe you aren’t familiar with everything above, but you’re a fast learner with enough experience to pick up new technologies quickly. You are comfortable communicating with everyone. You can handle not only technical conversations with our lead developer, but can turn right around and answer a legal question, jam on a new feature with our CEO, launch a last minute update for the marketing team, or sit down with a warehouse worker and talk about ways to make their life a little easier. You are up for a challenge. You derive joy from hard, but meaningful work. You enjoy getting into the flow.

Full Stack Developer,Alloy,"New York, NY 10001",,"Alloy's product can be roughly divided into two sides—a Django/React web app and a Node.js API. We're looking for help maintaining and building out features for the former (and really the latter, too, but that's a different job, and if that sounds fun then you should talk to my colleague Jeff).
**********
Who we are
**********
Alloy makes software to collect and manage customer data from many different sources. We help companies in financial services or other regulated industries safely onboard more ""good"" customers without introducing any more fraud into their systems. We connect many data sources used for identity verification into a rules engine, allowing a ""waterfall"" of information through a series of checks across different service providers.
The current team consists of 14 (three founders, four full-time engineers, two operations, two customer success, two data science, and one designer). Most of the team (i.e. everyone except for Laura, who lives in California) works from our office in Chinatown, New York, NY. We're nice people. We're also well-funded and post-revenue so your paychecks won't bounce.
****************
What you will do
****************
Design new features!
Talk to users, understand their requirements, and work with our full-time designer Rachelle to spec out beautiful new user experiences.
Build them!
Starting with the database design and finishing with the final UX and style touches, write good code that brings your features to life. Once they're tested, peer-reviewed, and QA'ed, they'll be deployed to our production environment.
Bugfixes!
What went wrong? How can we make sure it never happens again? We live for the root-cause analysis after getting things back up and running for our customers as soon as possible!
Support the team!
Keep the customer success crew in the loop for a feature timeline. Run a SQL query for operations to determine this month's billing amounts. Help out where you can!
You decide! It's a small team—the definition of the role is somewhat flexible and will grow to reflect your own strengths and interests!
***********************
What we are looking for
***********************
3+ years real-world experience working as a software developer on code in production.
While we like to think of ourselves as ""platform-agnostic"" in our hiring process, we expect that someone in this role will be familiar with or willing to learn our existing stack:
Python 3, Django - Serves as the back end for our dashboards.
ES6 React - Most of our complex front end logic, compiled to browser-agnostic Javascript by Webpack and Babel.
SCSS, Bootstrap 4 - Compiled by Webpack and Babel.
PostgreSQL - Our main data store.
Elasticsearch - For quick full-text searching.
Git/Github - Version control
AWS infrastructure tools
Unix command line
Teamwork experience!
We're open to people whose experience is mainly on personal projects and/or contracting but we'd really like someone who has experience working with a team.
College degree in computer science is helpful, but not necessary
********
Benefits
********
What we offer:
Health and dental benefits for you and your family
Dog-friendly office (i.e. you can bring a dog to work. You yourself cannot be a dog.)
Flexible work hours
Relocation pay - if you need to move to NYC, we'll pay to make it happen
Open vacation policy, and we actually mean it. (Seriously I know a lot of places say this and it effectively amounts to ""you should feel guilty every time you take a vacation"", but we're not one of those places)
Generous family leave options and support in returning to work
A salary in US Dollars that you can use on housing, groceries, bicycle maintenance—the sky is the limit!

You won’t lose sleep on a Tuft & Needle mattress, and you won’t lose sleep when you work with us either. T&N (tn.com) revolutionized the mattress space by turning the focus to the customer with always-honest pricing, an insistence on high-quality products, a world-class customer experience. T&N quickly became the most disruptive and innovative company in the e-commerce bedding space. Continuing to deliver on its mission in even bigger ways, we merged with Serta Simmons Bedding in September 2018, to expand the overall improvement to the industry. As a result, more and more people are resting easier every day.

Our stack consists primarily of Ruby, Rails, Postgres, React.js, CoffeeScript, HAML and SCSS and is deployed to Heroku and S3.

REQUIREMENTS:
End-to-end ownership: Each project gets an Engineering owner that is responsible for the success of the project.
Launch early and iterate: Done is better than perfect. Although we maintain a minimum standard of quality, we believe in getting value out of features and enhancements as soon as possible, while rapidly iterating.
Do things that don’t scale: We believe that our software should automate existing manual processes to save time, rather than preempt potential needs to avoid building unnecessary software. Our litmus test for deciding on new features is “Has the team done this manually first?”. Of course, we’re pragmatic even about this value.
Pragmatism: In a growing startup, our philosophy is that it’s important to be pragmatic. We are rarely dogmatic and use Judo moves to efficiently solve problems.
PREFERRED EXPERIENCE:
5+ years of experience working in a tech environment similar to what's described above
Empathy
Pragmatism
Curiosity
A love for learning

Full Stack Developer,,"Portsmouth, NH 03801",,"We’re looking for a developer that wants to play a key role in our client’s success.
Job Overview
As a part of the PixelMEDIA team, you’ll be delivering and supporting ecommerce websites for major worldwide brands.
What You’ll be Doing
You’ll be working with internal and client project teams to help define, build, and support ecommerce websites for major lifestyle brands that work seamlessly across different devices and browsers.
With a knack for creative problem solving, you’ll be an asset to the team in helping us bring projects in below budget and within deadlines.
You’ll thrive under the type of pressure an agency provides, and you’ll be able to handle working on multiple projects at once (though we’ll try to keep you dedicated when we can—we know you work better that way).
You’ll work constantly to keep your development skills and knowledge up to date, so you can help us figure out when a new technology makes sense to explore. You’ll also help us keep our internal coding standards up to date, and find areas for efficiency across disciplines. While we already use some great tools internally, you’ll help make recommendations on how we can continue to improve our development processes and become an even better place to work.
The Ideal Candidate
To be successful here, you should have strong knowledge of both backend and frontend development. Experience with server-side languages (such as C# or PHP) and strong interface development skills (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript) is a must.
Bonus points if you’re a top-notch troubleshooter, know the ins and outs of git, or an accessibility expert.
Ideally you have experience with supporting and/or implementing public-facing websites. If you’ve got strong experience on a major ecommerce platform, we’d like to talk. And we’d love to hear about any open source or side projects you work on.
But most importantly, you’re a
self-motivated problem solver
who doesn’t wait around to be told how to do things, but rather jumps into a project and gets after it quickly. With every task, you’re detail oriented and want to deliver the
best experience for the client
.
A Little More About Us
Based on the Pease Tradeport in Portsmouth, NH, PixelMEDIA is a digital commerce agency that helps our clients launch, manage, and grow their ecommerce business.
We’re a team of experts constantly striving to be the smartest digital commerce providers for lifestyle brands.
Our talented crew is made up of people who love to create, build, invent, produce and discover. We never stop searching for the best path for our clients—even if the journey is complex or seemingly hard to get to. That’s the difference between a mediocre, “just get it done” shop and an agency that gives a hoot, only resting when we’ve reached Pixel perfection.
We work, play and create together in the heart of Portsmouth, NH. Our home is part of what makes us who we are. Working in a beautiful, bustling, creative, best-food-ever kind of place that’s minutes to the beach and mountains makes our work/life balance as important as the work itself.

Marketing Designer,Hive,"Delhi, CA",,"About Hive:
Hive is a full stack deep learning platform helping to bring companies into the AI era.
Two Stanford graduate students determined to build practical applications using novel deep learning technologies founded
Hive
(https://thehive.ai/). From the beginning, we knew that high-quality datasets were critical to creating deep learning models. However, we also knew that the quantity of labeled data also has a huge impact on model performance. With this in mind, we first started by building a data- labelling platform specifically designed to solve machine-learning problems. This platform,
Hive Data
, is now the world’s largest distributed human workforce for data labelling and produces millions of high-quality annotations every day. Hive Data allows us to label uncommonly large datasets at a fraction of the cost that other data labelling solutions would charge. Once Hive Data was built, we were able to quickly label enormous datasets and rapidly build a suite of machine learning models that now form our core offerings in Hive Predict.
Our
Hive Predict
team has since built a wide range of custom machine learning models spanning a range of verticals including media, retail, security, and autonomous driving. Drawing on this experience and expertise, we then set out to build a stand-alone analytics platform for TV advertising called
Hive Media
. Hive Media synthesises our company's fundamental technologies and leverages industry partnerships to deliver a truly revolutionary product. Hive offers the only true, full- stack deep learning platform in the world, assisting clients with data labelling, model building, and the development of full enterprise solutions.
Today, we work with some of the largest companies in the world to redefine how they think about unstructured visual data and together we build solutions that completely transform verticals.

Android Developer,Hive,"Delhi, CA",,"About Hive:
Hive is a full stack deep learning platform helping to bring companies into the AI era.
Two Stanford graduate students determined to build practical applications using novel deep learning technologies founded
Hive
(https://thehive.ai/). From the beginning, we knew that high-quality datasets were critical to creating deep learning models. However, we also knew that the quantity of labeled data also has a huge impact on model performance. With this in mind, we first started by building a data- labelling platform specifically designed to solve machine-learning problems. This platform,
Hive Data
, is now the world’s largest distributed human workforce for data labelling and produces millions of high-quality annotations every day. Hive Data allows us to label uncommonly large datasets at a fraction of the cost that other data labelling solutions would charge. Once Hive Data was built, we were able to quickly label enormous datasets and rapidly build a suite of machine learning models that now form our core offerings in Hive Predict.
Our
Hive Predict
team has since built a wide range of custom machine learning models spanning a range of verticals including media, retail, security, and autonomous driving. Drawing on this experience and expertise, we then set out to build a stand-alone analytics platform for TV advertising called
Hive Media
. Hive Media synthesises our company's fundamental technologies and leverages industry partnerships to deliver a truly revolutionary product. Hive offers the only true, full- stack deep learning platform in the world, assisting clients with data labelling, model building, and the development of full enterprise solutions.
Today, we work with some of the largest companies in the world to redefine how they think about unstructured visual data and together we build solutions that completely transform verticals. We are fortunate to be funded by leading investors like Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), General Catalyst, Formation 8, and others. We have ~100 people globally, based in our San Francisco and Gurugram offices.
In order to execute our vision, we need to grow our team of best-in-class engineers. We are looking for talented
